# Metric

## What This Is

A top-down 2D turn-based tactical dungeon crawler with roguelite elements. Players explore procedurally generated dungeons with permadeath, but unlock persistent progression systems (new characters, upgrades, items) that carry across runs. A personal game project focused on creating an engaging "one more run" loop.

## Core Value

Meta-progression systems that make every death feel like progress toward something — unlocking new classes, permanent upgrades, and expanding the item pool keeps you coming back for more runs.

## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] Procedurally generated dungeon layouts with varied room types and connectivity
- [ ] Turn-based tactical combat with grid-based movement and meaningful decision-making
- [ ] Permadeath system that ends the run but preserves meta-progression
- [ ] Character/class unlock system with distinct playstyles
- [ ] Currency and persistent upgrade system that improves base stats/abilities
- [ ] Item/weapon unlock system that expands the loot pool for future runs
- [ ] Basic enemy variety with different tactical challenges
- [ ] Run completion tracking and progression visibility

### Out of Scope

- Multiplayer/co-op — Single-player only for v1, focus on solo experience
- Complex narrative/story systems — Gameplay loop first, light lore at most
- Advanced visual effects/3D graphics — Simple 2D assets, focus on mechanics

## Context

This is a personal game project inspired by classic roguelites like Binding of Isaac, Hades, and traditional roguelikes. The focus is on creating tight gameplay loops where each run teaches you something and unlocks progress toward the next attempt.

The turn-based tactical combat provides a deliberate, strategic feel compared to action roguelites, allowing for careful planning of each move while maintaining the quick iteration of roguelite runs.

## Constraints

- **None specified** — Open to appropriate technology choices based on requirements

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Top-down 2D perspective | Classic roguelike/roguelite view that works well for tactical grid-based combat | — Pending |
| Turn-based tactical combat | Allows for strategic depth and careful decision-making vs real-time action | — Pending |
| Multiple meta-progression systems | Classes + upgrades + item unlocks provides varied progression hooks | — Pending |
